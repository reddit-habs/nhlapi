The installation of the package it pretty staight forward. Make sure you have a recent version of `pip` and run

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/reddit-habs/nhlapi

Depending on which client to choose to use, you will need to install either :code:`requests` or :code:`aiohttp`.
More information on this can be found on the :ref:`quickstart` page.

The package has not been published to pypi as of now, there is a package named `nhlapi` but it is not this package.
